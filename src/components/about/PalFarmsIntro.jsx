        At Pal Frozen Foods, everything starts with the land. Long before a
        vegetable is washed, cut, or frozen, it grows under the open sky, cared
        for by the hands of farmers who follow the rhythms of nature and the
        standards we set together. Pal Farms is not just a source of raw
        material, it’s the heart of our entire journey. This is where purity,
        honesty, and quality take root.
